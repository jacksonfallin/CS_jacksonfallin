 <h2>Orientation</h2>
 </div>
<p>
For this lab you will implement a program that mimics data analysis
for an e-commerce site.  You will implement a set of classes (largely as
determined by you) to represent the data stored in a "log" file. You will
then work with the in-memory structures to compute various statistics on 
the collected data.
</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>Objectives</h2>
</div>

<ul>
<li><p>Understand the provided base code that reads data from each line of a file
   into an array of strings</p></li>
<li><p>Write code to process the data into appropriate data structures,
   including writing your own classes and creating hash maps, lists
   and sets as needed.
   </p></li>
<li><p>Write code that operates on the data in order to compute statistics
   about it, including building relations between various items, and
   computing averages, differences, and counting given specific
   items.</p></li>
<li>Understand using a <code>Map</code> to canonicalize objects.
</ul>
<div class="header">
<h2>Given Files</h2>
</div>

<p>
Retrieve the files provided for this lab in 
<code>lab5given</code>.
</a>
</p>

<p>
These given files include base code to help in the task of analyzing log data.
Your final program will need to read in e-commerce like data from a file and
compute statistics based on the information in the log.  The base code
implements the file reading and some of the parsing, but not the processing of 
the data read.  You will need to complete the processing of the data for this lab, 
including putting the data into appropriate data structures (e.g. not just an
array of strings).  You are encouraged to read through the provided code.
</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>Log File</h2>
</div>

<p>
Examine the provided log files.  For example, look at the contents of
<code>small.log</code>. You will find various entries
representing customer use of an imaginary e-commerce site.  Each entry
will appear on a single line in the file and consist of an entry
type tag followed by the corresponding entry attributes.  The
different types of entries and their attributes are as follows.
</p>

<ul>
   <li><p><b><code>START sessionId customerRegion customerIDInRegion</code></b></p></li>
   <li><p><b><code>VIEW sessionId productId price</code></b></p></li>
   <li><p><b><code>BUY sessionId productId price quantity</code></b></p></li>
   <li><p><b><code>END sessionId</code></b></p></li>
</ul>

<p>
Each <code>sessionId</code> is a unique identifier represented as a
<code>String</code>,
each <code>productId</code> is a unique identifier represented as a
<code>String</code>,
each <code>price</code> is an integer number of cents, and
each <code>quantity</code> is an integer.  Both customerRegion and
customerIDInRegion are strings, and the two taken together
uniquely identify a customer.
</p><p>
Note that a session can end and re-start.  If this happens, it will always
be for the same customer.
</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>Task</h2>
</div>

<p>
Your program will take the name of a log file as a command-line argument.
It must then read the file and create data structures in memory
in order to process the data.  Your program will then operate on the
data in memory, and output the results of computing the statistics discussed
below.
</p>

<p>
You must determine how to represent the entries and which data structures
to use for processing the data.  Look at the provided code, where you will
find several clues.  Though you might be tempted to simplify
the data since not all of it is used in the required analysis, avoid that
temptation.  Define classes, as appropriate, to represent the
entries, giving consideration for cohesion and coupling.
</p>

<p>
You should note that within the provided source file there is an example of
such processing and the use of the <code>Session</code> data structure to 
store some of the information.  You will also note that during parsing, the key used to 
look up the <code>Session</code> is not itself a <code>Session</code> object.  It is just
the key, and it is a type that has 
<code>equals()</code> and <code>hashCode()</code> defined for it.  This
strategy is known as <b>canonicalizing</b> the <code>Session</code> objects.  With 
this strategy, there is only ever one, "canonical" instance of <code>Session</code> to
represent each session, even if it has to be looked up more than once.  For that
reason, <code>Session</code> objects can be used as the key in a hash table, even though
<code>Session</code> inherits the default <code>equals()</code> 
and <code>hashCode()</code> implementation from <code>java.lang.Object</code>.
That's because, with one unnique ("canonical") object representing each session, 
object identity and object equivalence are the same thing.

</p><p>
You might consider canonicalizing one or more of the other data types in your code
by their lookup key.
</p>

<p>
Your program is only expected to analyze correctly formatted and
organized log
files.  In particular, for a given <code>sessionId</code>, all <code>VIEW</code>
and <code>BUY</code> entries will come after a <code>START</code> entry and
come before, if present, an <code>END</code> entry.  It is possible that
a session may not have ended when the log file was taken.  It is also possible
for a session to end and re-start, but if this happens, it will always be
for the same customer.
</p>

<div class="header">
<h3>Statistics</h3>
</div>

<p>
Your program must compute the following statistics.
</p>

<ul>
   <li><p>Print the average number of items viewed by a customer
      during a session where no purchase is made.  In other words, over
      all sessions where a purchase <em>is not</em> made,
      compute the average number of views (VIEW entries). <i>Note that
      viewing the same item more than once should be counted - you are
      computing the average "views," not the average number of items
      viewed.</i>
   </p></li>
   <li><p>For each <code>sessionId</code> associated with a purchase,
      print, for each productId, the purchase price (in cents)
      minus the average price of the items viewed during that session.
      Keep in mind that there may be multiple purchases in a given session.
      <i>Note that you do not need to account for the quantity of the
      purchased item, just compute the difference of the unit price on a
      given product.</i>  This should be sorted by session ID, and within a
      session, the buys should be sorted by product ID.
   </p></li>
   <li><p>For each customer, for each product that customer purchased,
      print the number of sessions in which that customer viewed that
      product. 
      <i>Note you are computing the number of sessions in which
      the purchased item was viewed, not the total number of views of that
      item.</i>
      Sort the customers by customer region, then by the ID code within
      the region.  Within each customer, sort the products by ID.
   </p></li>
</ul>

<p>
The output of your program when run on the provided <code>small.log</code>
file should be exactly as follows.
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
Average Views without Purchase: 3.0

Price Difference for Purchased Product by Session
    session0
        product3 125.0
    session2
        product3 125.0

Number of Views for Purchased Product by Customer
    region1 customer0
        product3 1
    region2 customer0
        product3 2
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note that alphabetical order with numbers can sometimes be
surprising.  "2" comes after "17," because "2" is after "1"
in the "alphabet."
</p>

<h2>How to tackle this lab...</h2>
<p>
This is a longer lab and requires you to solve some data processing
challenges on your own.  You might want to consider these steps.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To start, make sure you understand the log file format.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider class designs to store important entries from the log file.</p></li>
<li><p>Look at main and how the data processing is proceeding (i.e. 
<code>LogAnalyzer.main()</code> calls <code>LogParser.parse()</code>, which 
calls <code>processLine()</code>, which then processes the entries differently 
(you will write two of them)).</p></li>
<li><p>Think about the collection data structure you will use to store all the data - you will allocate that data structure in main and then pass it to the relevant methods mentioned above until you get down to the point of actually creating objects and storing them. Get a grasp of the control flow and make sure the general idea of how you are going to store data makes sense - if it does not at this point, stop and talk to your instructor or neighbor.</p></li>
<li><p>Fill in the important data processing steps (processViewEntry and processBuyEntry)</p></li>
<li><p>Stop here and enable the printOutExample method by modifying
<code>Constants.java</code> so that it prints out your processed data.  It should 
like the following for <code>small.log</code>,
though the entries might not be in the same order.</p></li>
<blockquote>
<pre>
Customer(region=region2, idInRegion=customer0)
    in Session(id=session0, customer=Customer(region=region2, idInRegion=customer0))
        looked at Product(id=product0)
        looked at Product(id=product1)
        looked at Product(id=product3)
        looked at Product(id=product3)
    in Session(id=session1, customer=Customer(region=region2, idInRegion=customer0))
        looked at Product(id=product1)
    in Session(id=session3, customer=Customer(region=region2, idInRegion=customer0))
        looked at Product(id=product1)
        looked at Product(id=product1)
        looked at Product(id=product0)
        looked at Product(id=product1)
        looked at Product(id=product3)
    in Session(id=session0, customer=Customer(region=region2, idInRegion=customer0))
        looked at Product(id=product0)
        looked at Product(id=product1)
        looked at Product(id=product3)
        looked at Product(id=product3)
Customer(region=region1, idInRegion=customer0)
    in Session(id=session2, customer=Customer(region=region1, idInRegion=customer0))
        looked at Product(id=product3)
        looked at Product(id=product2)
        looked at Product(id=product2)
        looked at Product(id=product0)
    in Session(id=session2, customer=Customer(region=region1, idInRegion=customer0))
        looked at Product(id=product3)
        looked at Product(id=product2)
        looked at Product(id=product2)
        looked at Product(id=product0)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<li><p>Now you are ready to write the code to compute statistics on your data; take each task one at a time.
</p></li>
<li><p>Next, test to make sure your output matches and you are done! </p></li>
