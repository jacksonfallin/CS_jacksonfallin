To better organize all of the code, I found it best to place the methods within 
functions.java into their respective classes. I did this by first analyzing 
the parameters of the original methods and placed them within the class. For 
example, 'executeAction' had parameters 'Action action' and 'EventScheduler 
scheduler'. I placed this method within the Action class, removed the param 'Action
action' and replaced all action calls within the method to 'this'. I did this for 
all methods as well as all functions assiting the original methods (ie. 'setAlpha'). 
It really was not too difficult, more time consuming really. As for the 
functions class, I ultimetly removed everything from the class as I felt there was
a suitable place for everything.
