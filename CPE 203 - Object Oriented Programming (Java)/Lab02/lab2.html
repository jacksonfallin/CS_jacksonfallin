<h2>Orientation</h2>
</div>

<p>
This lab explores writing static methods versus instance methods in Java.  Both are useful ways to get something done (a computation), but as we develop more complex code, there are lots of reasons to strongly associate a computation with a specific instance of an object (associate data and computation together in one object).
</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>Objectives</h2>
</div>

<ul>
<li>To be able to write static methods that can compute the perimeter of three different types of geometric shapes (Circle, Rectangle and Polygon)(part 1)
<li>To be able to write instance methods to compute the perimeter of three different types of geometric shapes (part 2)
<li>To be able to write a static method to compare the perimeters of different objects (part 1 & 2)
<li>To be able to write your own test cases to create geometric shapes and test the computation of their perimeter, and the computation of comparison of their sizes (measured as perimeter) (part 1 & 2)
</ul>


<div class="header">
<h2>Resources</h2>
</div>

<p>
The same JUnit library as before.  Starting with this lab, the assignment
repository will start out empty, and the lab materials are given in the
general repository.  Please copy part1 and part2 into the empty repository
created for the assignment.  This gives you more freedom to arrange
your files the way IDEA likes, if you choose to use IDEA.  Please do keep
part1 and part2 in their own subdirectories!
</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>Part 1: Classes and Overloaded Methods</h2>
</div>

<p>
In the provided <code>part1</code> subdirectory, implement the following
classes with these general requirements:
</p>

<ul>
   <li><p>Each instance variable must be <code>private</code> and
      <code>final</code>.</p></li>
   <li><p>Provide the appropriate "accessor"/"getter" methods for the
      instance variables. (see PartOneTestCases.java for names)</p></li>
   <li><p>You may add methods beyond those required, but any such
      additional method must be <code>private</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
<span class="warning">Automaton Warning:</span>  You are an intelligent
person; you should not just mechanically apply these rules only to satisfy
a style checker in order to complete the lab.  Instead, consider the
reasons for these rules, what violating them exposes to the user/client
of the corresponding class, and what following them guarantees to you,
the implementer. If you aren't sure, ask your neighbor, they might have
thoughts of their own.
</p>

<div class="header">
<h3>Classes</h3>
</div>

<p>
The following assumes your two-dimensional <code>Point</code> implementation
from the previous lab.  Copy your <code>Point.java</code> into the working
directory.
</p>

<p>Implement these classes.</p>

<ul>
   <li><p><code>Circle.java</code> represents a circle given a
      <code>Point</code> center and a <code>double</code> radius.</p></li>
   <li><p><code>Rectangle.java</code> represents an axis-aligned rectangle
      given a <code>Point</code> top-left and a <code>Point</code>
      bottom-right.</p></li>
   <li><p><code>Polygon.java</code> represents a polygon given
      <code>List&lt;Point&gt;</code> points.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Note that as your implementation will be tested with an uninteeligent
automaton, PartOneTestCases.java, you'll save some time by seeing exactly
what expected method names it's looking for.  Search for
expectedMethodNames in the appropriate test methods.</b>
</p>

<div class="header">
<h3>Overloaded Method</h3>
</div>

<p>
Define a <code>Util</code> class with three <code>static</code>
<code>perimeter</code> methods.  Each such method takes, as its single
parameter, one of the classes defined in the previous step (i.e., there
is one <code>perimeter</code> method that takes a <code>Circle</code>,
one <code>perimeter</code> method that takes a <code>Polygon</code>,
etc.) and returns the perimeter of the object (as a <code>double</code>).
</p>

<p>
You can assume for now that all constructors will create correct closed
shapes.
</p>

<p>
A method (or methods) like <code>perimeter</code> is considered overloaded
since there is a separate definition for different parameter types.  
</p>

<p>
Note that to call a static method like these, you can invoke:
<code>
Util.perimeter(new Circle(new Point(0, 0), 1.0));
</code>
</p>

<p>
<span class="warning">Deeper Understanding:</span> How does the Java
implementation know which version of <code>perimeter </code> to use when the
method is invoked (not-so-great hint at this point, the compiler determines
the implementation under this scenario)?  If the answer is not apparent, then
think about the different method invocations and speak with those around you.
If the answer seems obvious, then hold on to that belief for the next few weeks
to see if it continues to hold.
</p>

<div class="header">
<h3>Methods in Action</h3>
</div>

<p>
Define a <code>Bigger</code> class with one
<code>static whichIsBigger</code> method.  This helper method will take
three parameters a <code>Circle, Rectangle, and Polygon</code> and will
return a <code>double</code> representing the largest perimeter of the
three objects. Please write a test case that uses this method to determine 
which is the largest between:
</p>

<ol>
<li> a cirle centered at {1.0, 1.0} with radius of 2.0 
<li> a rectangle with the corners {-1.0, 2.0} and {1.0, -1.6}
<li> a polygon defined by {0, 0}, {3, 1}, {1, 4}, and {-1, 4}
</ol>

<p>
You may want to test your perimeter computations first (see next section).
</p>

<div class="header">
<h3>Tests</h3>
</div>

<p>We are, of course, testing all of these operations.  Add your
tests to the provided <code>PartOneTestCases.java</code> file.</p>

<p>
You are expected to write at least one test case for each perimeter and one
test case for whichIsBigger.  
<b>That means you must submit at least 8 tests (as there are some already there for implementation details).</b>
</p>

<p>
Helper: here is an example of testing the perimeter for a polygon:<br>

<PRE>
   @Test
   public void testPerimPoly() {
        List&lt;Point&gt;points = new ArrayList&lt;Point &gt;(); 
        points.add(new Point(0, 0));
        points.add(new Point(3,0));
        points.add(new Point(0,4));
        double d = Util.perimeter(new Polygon(points));
        assertEquals(12.0, d, DELTA);
   }<br>
</PRE>

<div class="header">
<h2>Part 2: Methods</h2>
</div>

<p>Copy your source files files from <code>part1</code> into 
<code>part2</code>, with the exception of the test file.

<p>The definition of <code>perimeter</code> in the first part of this
lab does not follow an object-oriented style.  This part of the lab
asks that you make a few modifications to improve the code (further
such improvements can come with later material).
<i>Don't worry this part will be easier!</i>
</p>

<p>
From <code>Util.java</code>, move each <code>perimeter</code> method
into the appropriate class (as an instance method, that is, one not
marked as static) corresponding to <code>perimeter</code>'s parameter.
The goal is that each object can be asked to compute its own perimeter.
As such, <code>perimeter</code> will no longer need to take a parameter,
because it acts on <code>this</code>, which refers to the object on which the
method was invoked.  Once you're done moving functions, Util.java should
be empty, so you can remove it.
</p>
<p>
NOTE:  The <code>Util.java</code> solution is not a particularly good design.
It is intended that you have all of the logic of computing the perimiter in
Util.java, and not in the different shapes, even though the latter would be
a different design.  This is done just to demonstrate method overloading.
</p>

<p>
Be sure to also copy over the <code>Bigger</code> class and revise it to 
use your new instance methods.
<i>Take a moment... do you like one style over the other?</i>
</p>

<div class="header">
<h3>Tests</h3>
</div>

<p>Add tests to the provided <code>PartTwoTestCases.java</code> file.
This is another place you'll be able to see the effect of having the 
methods associated with the objects, versus static methods that are part
of some other class.
<b>Again, there should be an added test for each of the types of perimeters
and a test of whichIsBigger (can you challenge your neighbor with new perimeters?)</b>

<i>Reflect, do you like one style over the other?</i>
</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>Submission and Demo</h2>
</div>

<p>
Be sure to commit and push your code by 11:59pm on the due date.  Your 
instructor will run additional tests on your code, which will account 
for the bulk of the available points for this lab. <br /><br />
Demonstrate <b>both</b> parts of your working program to your instructor at
once.  Be prepared to show your source code. You will need to demo your
working code IN LAB on first lab after it is due to be submitted.
