Hello Professor Foote,

As requested I have sent you an email and updated my repo to include this text file and a folder, 
containing all my .java files. If you recall, I submitted my assignment 5 two days 
late as I felt that if I submitted it earlier, I would have received a far worse 
score than 85%.
