  <div class="header">  <h1>Lab 7, CSC 203 - depth first search</h1></div>

<p>
This lab explores a recursive algorighm:  a depth-first
search on a two-dimensional grid (a simple graph).  This depth-first
search is a simple "pathing" algorithm.
</p>

 <div class="header">
 <h2>Objectives</h2>
 </div>
 
<ul>
<li><p>To implement depth first search
<li><p>Practice thinking about trajectory planning on a 2D grid structure
</ul>


<div class="header">
<h2>Overview</h2>
</div>
Get the base code from either
<a href="lab7given/text/">lab7given/text/</a> or from
<a href="lab7given/graphical/">lab7given/graphical/</a>.  The two
versions are functionally equivalent.  The text version will work
from a terminal, and does not require any libraries.  The graphical
version is prettier, but requires a graphical display, and it requires
that the processing-core library be in your CLASSPATH.
</a>
<p>
Begin with the base code.  Note that this code represents the world as 
a 2D grid.  As is normally the case in computer graphics, the program
uses a 2D coordinate system where {0, 0} is the upper left corner.
This means that as the y value of a coordinate increases, the point is 
<em>lower</em> on the screen. The following image shows the general 
structure:<br>

<p>
The project we have been working with this quarter
is using a similar data structure.  This lab's code is a much simpler
version of a virutal world.
<p>
Test to make sure the base code works for you.  You might be able to run
it with the provided <code>run.sh</code> script on Mac/Unix, or the
<code>run.cmd</code> script from the Windows command prompt.
When your program starts 
it should look something like this.  The eventual goal is for the
wyvern to find a valid path to the water, only traversing the grass and not 
the rock obstacles:
</p>

<p>
If you're using the text version, your screen should look like this:
</p>

<h2>Getting started - Background</h2>
</div>
<p>
Open the provided Java file and read through the code.  You will
adapt this code to the project in an assignment.
</p>

<h2>Text Version</h2>
<p>
The text version of the program creates a <code>GridDisplay</code>
object.  This object manages the screen and prints out the grid.
You don't need to modify it.  You just call <code>setTile()</code>
to set the character respresentation at a given row/column position,
and <code>printGrid()</code> each time you want to print out the
grid.  There's also a <code>delayForMilliseconds()</code> method
you can use to achieve an animation effect.
</p><p>
You should find the code in <code>PathingMain</code> that asks for
input when you run the program.  It calls the method <code>moveOnce()</code>
each time it want to advance the path by a step.  You will modify the
<code>moveOnce()</code> method as described below.
<h2>Grahpical Version</h2>

<p>
The library requirements of the processing library begins with the 
definition of a class that extends <code>PApplet</code> and that 
includes a <code>main</code>
method like the following to create a PApplet using the specified
class.
</p>

<pre>

   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      PApplet.main("PathingMain");
   }

</pre>

<p>
This class overrides three important methods: <code>setup</code>,
<code>draw</code> and <code>keyPressed()</code>.  The <code>setup</code> 
method is run once when
the, in Processing terminology, "sketch" is created.  The
<code>draw</code> method is called repeatedly (by Processing) and
will draw the tiles of the "sketch".
</p>
<p>
The <code>keyPressed()</code> method is called when a key is pressed.  A
protected field called <code>key</code> holds the key that was pressed.
(Note that this is an example where the processing-core library
does not follow good design practices.  It would be better if the key
were passed in to keyPressed() as an argument.)  The
<code>keyPressed()</code> method calls <code>moveOnce()</code>.
You should modify the <code>moveOnce</code> method as described below.
</p><p>
NOTE:  You must return from <code>keyPressed()</code> for the
pathing library to be able to update the screen.  For this reason, you
should only try to take one step each time <code>keyPressed()</code> is
called.
</p>
<h2>Both Versions</h2>
<p>
As it stands, in the base code, the pathing algorighm only moves down and to
the right.  The code is there to give you an example
of working with the grid data structure.
<p>


<p>
You will also see that the code includes
a two-dimensional array to represent the "world".  This grid
should be 20x15.  For this lab, you will use this grid to store
background tiles, obstacle tiles, and a goal tile.  The code uses
an enum value represent these different types of tiles, specifically:<br>
<blockquote>
<code>enum GridValues { BACKGROUND, OBSTACLE, GOAL, SEARCHED }</code>
</blockquote>
</p>

<h2>Step 1</h2>
</div>

<em>At this point you need to implement depth first search.</em>  Note you 
can visit the neighboring nodes in whichever order you like.  Perhaps you
can try visiting in various orders, and ultimately select an ordering 
that clearly illustrates that the search runs into the obstacles at 
some point.  In other words, don't pick directions that result in never
visiting a grid cell that is occupied by an obstacle.
</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>Step 2</h2>
</div>

<p>
After the search completes, make sure that the code in place to 
display the path.  make sure you understand how cells are being 
added to path, and how the path is represented.
In the below example image, all the cells with a blue square have 
been visited, and the grid cells that make up the path are shown 
with red.
</p><p>
For avoidance of doubt, when you are finished, the wyverin should always
find the water without any manual intervention.  You should never need
to press "c" to manually clear a path.  The wyverin should be adjacent to
the water.
</p>

<img src="html_images/path.png">
<p>
The equivalent image from the text version is shown below.
The wyverin is "W", the visited nodes are "+", the obstacles
are "O", the path is "p" and the goal is "G".

    Enter 'c' to clear the current path.
    Enter 'e' to explore a new path.
          'e' plus a number for multiple steps
    Enter 'q' to quit.
