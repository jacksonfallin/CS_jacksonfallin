  <div class="header">  <h1>Assignment 3 ("Design Document 2"), CSC/CPE 203</h1>
  </div>

<p>
In the first pair of assignments you identified methods and moved them
into the most approprite classes.  In doing so, you may
have noticed that some classes support functionality (behaviors, largely
due to what its methods do) that
are not appropriate for all instances of the class.  Moreover, these
classes support data attributes that are not used by all instances
of the class.
</p>

<p>
This is an issue of <em>cohesion</em>.  Specifically, these classes 
exhibit low (poor) cohesion by representing
multiple (admittedly related) concepts by combining all attributes and
methods used by each concept.  Tips for identifying classes with low cohesion
are given later.
</p>

<p>
This design assignment and the next programming assignment
asks that you improve the code base by splitting
classes exhibiting low cohesion into multiple highly cohesive classes.
Doing so in the context of Java will require identifying common methods for
each subset of these new classes and then introducing a new <b>interface</b>
for each logical grouping of these methods (more on this below).
</p>

<div class="header">
 <h2>Objectives</h2>
 </div>
 
<ul>
<li>Deepen your understanding of the specific functionality of the large project code
<li>To be able to identify where cohesion is low in an exisiting class design
<li>To be able to modify an exisiting UML diagram (adding classes and interfaces 
    where needed to improve the overall code design in terms of cohesion)
<li>Specifically, for this assignment, in the UML, create new classes and interfaces 
    to remove the need for enumerated types for <code>*Kind</code> and any other 
    classes that contain methods that do not support the primary role of instances 
    of that class.
</ul>


<div class="header">
<h2>Task Overview</h2>
</div>

<p>
You must identify those classes with low cohesion and then split these
classes into separate classes exhibiting high cohesion.  When you do
this in a program, each of
these new classes introduces a separate type.  When you do this,
you typically need to "root" these new types 
at a single type (typically defined by an <code>interface</code>) so that
there is a common Java supertype for classes that use your types.
You will not introduce any additional classes beyond those used to improve 
cohesion
(e.g., you will not use inheritance in this pair of assignments).  This
refactoring is quite likely to increase the amount of code through the
duplication of some methods; this is expected and ok at this time.
</p>

<p>
Based on the original source code, there are likely two categories of
classes with low cohesion.  The first category consists of those classes
that depend on <code>ActionKind</code> or <code>EntityKind</code>.  The
second category depends on your final distribution of the methods in
the original <code>Functions</code> class.
</p>

<ul>
   <li><p>Kind: The original source code uses <code>ActionKind</code> and
      <code>EntityKind</code> to allow each <code>Action</code> instance
      and each <code>Entity</code> instance to play one of potentially many
      roles.  As a starting point of your refactoring, you are to eliminate these
      <code>*Kind</code> enum classes, by introducing a class for
      each "kind" of object.
      </p>
   </li>
   <li><p>Review all of the classes, including the ones your just refactored,
      with a focus on cohesion.  Does a class contain data that is not used 
      by all instances of the class?  For example, does each "kind" (each subset)
      use only subsets of the data?  Are there groups of methods that are only
      called for certain subsets of classes that share a common interface?  Are
      there methods with an empty implementation of some methods?  Does a class
      contain methods that do not support the primary role of instances
      of the class?  These are all signs that some additional refactoring
      can be done.  Perhaps there are subtypes of Entity, or maybe other
      interfaces that could be introduced?</p>
    <li><p>
      Finally, look for things like groups of static methods, like the ones used to
      create instances or parse files.  You don't need to use inheritance, but
      grouping related methods in a single class can be a good way to increase
      cohesion.  If things can be made private, that reduces coupling, too.  Finally,
      look out for static methods that can be eliminated entirely!
      </p>
   </li>
</ul>

<p>
As before, you are encouraged to develop both the UML design document and
the code refactoring at the same time. You are further encouraged to
implement the refactoring incrementally so that your refactored program
executes properly at each step. You will submit the design document before
the final refactoring submission to allow for feedback on your design that
can then be incorporated into your refactoring.
</p>

<h3>Introducing Interfaces</h3>
</div>

<p>
The following are some tips on approaching the introduction of interfaces
to support splitting classes.
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> An interface shouldn't have a method that isn't applicable
to all of the classes that implement that interface.  In more advanced
situations, it's not uncommon for the implementation of a method for certain 
types of objects (certain classes) to be "do nothing," but in this kind
of simple object decomposition, this should be extremely rare.  Further,
a class should not normally implement an interface and then define a method
required by the interface that raises an exception indicating that the method
is not supported.
</p>

<p>
Your introduction of interfaces for this project must
be meaningful.  It is insufficient to define a single interface with all
methods that are then only partially implemented by each of the classes.
</p>

<ul>
   <li><p>First, copy the original class to each of the new classes (each
      defining a single role).  This can be easily done in the UML editor.
   </p></li>
   <li><p>In each new class, eliminate each data attribute not used by
      this class and each method not supported by this class.  (For this
      project, you can examine how instances playing this role are created
      as a hint about which data attributes are actually used.)
   </p></li>
   <li><p>Change the original class into an interface declaring only those
      methods shared by every new class.
   </p></li>
   <li><p>Group the new classes into sets with similar functionality.
      Introduce additional interfaces as appropriate (see below).
   </p></li>
   <li><p>Examine the original uses of the objects (before this change)
      to determine which methods are used by client code.  Can the client
      code still access that method based on the reference type?  Will it
      be able to do so if you change the type to one of the interfaces that
      you have already introduced?
   </p></li>
</ul>

<p>
The above tips apply to creating the UML diagram.  <b>When you refactor the code,
be sure to read "Tips on Refactoring Methods" in
<a href="assignment4.html#refactoring">Assignment 4</a>.</b>


<div class="header">
<h2>Design Document</h2>
</div>

<p>
   Your "design document" will consist only of an updated UML diagram.
Copy the UML diagram from the prior design assignment to
<code>Interfaces.graphml</code>.  Then update this copy to reflect the
new classes and the interfaces.
</p>

<p>
   You can add an <b>interface</b> to the UML document by adding a class
and then, under the <em>UML</em> tab in properties, setting the
<em>Stereotype</em> field to "interface".  For each interface that a class
implements, be sure to draw an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_diagram#Relationships">
appropriate arrow</a> (dashed line with open triangle head) from the class
to the interface.  If an interface extends another interface in your design,
then be sure to connect them with an appropriate arrow (solid line with open
triangle head).
