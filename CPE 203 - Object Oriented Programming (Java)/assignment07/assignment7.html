  <div class="header">  <h1>Assignment 7 ("Program 5"), CSC/CPE 203</h1>
  </div>

<p>
For this assignment you will modify the virtual world to support a
"world-changing" event.  This event is to be triggered by a mouse press.
When the mouse button is pressed at a location on the screan, it should
affect the tiles near to the button press. The event must be visualized 
by changing
the affected background tiles and by modifying the affected entities
(more below).  In addition, the world event must create a new type
of entity.
</p>
<div class="header">
 <h2>Objectives</h2>
 </div>
 
<ul>
<li>Add new functionality to existing code base demonstrating an
understanding of the exisiting design and functionality
<li>Be able to evaluate the current design based on the experience of
adding to the code 
</ul>

<h2>Concurrent Modification Exception</h2>
</div>

<p>
One thing to watch out for is a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ConcurrentModificationException.html">java.util.ConcurrentModificationException</a>.
This exception can be generated if you attempt to modify a collection,
like a set, while you
are iterating over that same collection.  This could happen, for example, 
if you attempted to make a modification to the set of entities while you are
iterating over that set.
</p><p>
There are several ways to solve this problem.  In this case, one reasonable
solution is to refrain from adding to or removing from the set during
iteration.  Instead, you can defer any modification of the set until
the iteration is finished.  This can be done by creating an action or an
event to perform the modification, once the iteration is finished.  That
action needs to be stored on a list of pending work, and processed once
the iteration is complete.
</p><p>
Another reasonable
solution is to simply copy all of the elements of the set into an 
<code>ArrayList</code>, 
and iterate over the list.  This is a fairly standard technique, except
when dealing with very large sets.  For example, consider the following code:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>void modifyList(Set&lt;Something> theSet) {
    ArrayList&lt;<Something> copy = new ArrayList(theSet);
    for (Something s : copy) {
        if (I don't like s) {
            theSet.remove(s);
        }
        if (I want to add something to the set) {
            Something newElement = ...
            theSet.add(s);
        }
    }
}</pre></blockquote>
<p>
If we were to iterate directly over the set, we would not be able to add
and remove elements during the iteration.

<h2>World Changing Event: Detecting a Mouse Press</h2>
</div>
<p>
The processing core library has an admittedly odd mechanism for an application
to receive a notification when a mouse is pressed.  Assuming that
<code>VirtualWorld</code> is still your sublcass of 
<code>processing.core.PApplet</code>, add the following code to your
<code>setup()</code> method:
<blockquote><pre>    registerMethod("mouseEvent", this);</pre></blockquote>
<p>
and add the following method to the class:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>public void mouseEvent(processing.event.MouseEvent event) {
    if (event.getAction() == processing.event.MouseEvent.PRESS) {
        int x = event.getX();
        int y = event.getY();
        System.out.println("Mouse pressed at " + x + ", " + y);
    }
}</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Because of the odd way that the processing library handles this method,
you can <strong>not</strong> mark it with <code>@Override</code>.
</p>


<div class="header">
<h2>World Changing Event: Visualization</h2>
</div>

<p>
Decide on a world-changing event, like a river spawning, a volcano erupting,
or a rainbow being cast across the land.  This event must be triggered
by a mouse-click and must affect at least 7 background tiles of the world 
in proximity to the mouse position when the click occurs, unless the click
occurs at the edge of the world.  Note that background
tiles might be obscured by an entity, so there might be a visible change in
fewer than 7 tiles.  The event should affect no more than half of the world.
</p>

<p>
The world event must be visualized by modifying the background image associated
with the affected tiles.  You are free to modify them however you would
like, and are encouraged to be creative.  Remember that a tile is
<code>TILE_WIDTH</code> pixels wide and <code>TILE_HEIGHT</code> pixels high.
Some methods that might come in handy, at least to get started,
are <code>createImageColored()</code>, <code>viewportToWorld()</code>,
and <code>setBackground()</code>

</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>World Changing Event: Effect</h2>
</div>

<p>
At least one type of existing mobile entity (e.g., miners or blobs)
must be affected by the world event, based on proximity to the event
location.  More specifically, this type of entity should change in
appearance and behavior.
</p>

<p>
For example, a rainbow might change nearby miners into fairies that seek
out crystals.  Or the event might make the blacksmith start to move,
while maintaining the minerâ€™s prior behavior of bringing ore to a blacksmith.
</p>

<p>
The affected/transformed entities should change appearance and should
change behavior.
</p>


<div class="header">
<h2>World Changing Event: New Entity</h2>
</div>

<p>
The world event must cause a new type of mobile entity to spawn.  This
new entity should animate and move according to logic defined by you.
</p>

<p>
For instance, the new entity might seek out blobs to turn them into 
crystals, chase down miners to infect them with the plague, or travel
the world spreading apple seeds.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> This new entity is in addition to the entity transformation
triggered by the event as just discussed.
</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>Description</h2>
</div>

<p>
Include a text file named <code>WORLD_EVENT.txt</code> in your submission that
describes 1) how to trigger the event, 2) what should happen when the
event is triggered, 3) what the affected entities should do, and 4) what
the new entity is and how it should behave.
</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>Design</h2>
</div>

<p>
   Be sure to adhere to the design principles discussed this quarter.
Refactor your code as needed, and resist the urge for quick hacks that
would increase maintenance costs.
</p>

<p>
   You are encouraged to reflect on the quality of your design and the
effort required to add the functionality for this assignment.  How do
you think this effort compares to that needed to add the same functionality
to the originally given code?  Consider what would be required in the old
code to add a new entity whose movement is quite different than the original
set of entities.
</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>Assignment Submission</h2>
</div>

Be sure to ask your instructor how to submit your sections code.
<p>
Your submission must include all source files, including those that
are unchanged.  Your grader should be able to build your project based
on the files submitted.  You <b><u>must also</u></b> submit all image
files, the image list, and the world save file, since this assignment
requires changes to some/all of these.  You do not need to include
any jar files, however.
</p>
<p>
To create at empty GitHub repository for submission, accept the assignment
at <a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/dG6l-C1L">https://classroom.github.com/a/dG6l-C1L</a>.
</p><p>
Your submission must include all source files, including any that
are unchanged.  Your grader should be able to build your project based
on the files submitted.  Please also submit the image files,
the image list, and the world save file.  
</p><p>
Please be sure to so verify that you have submitted everything properly.
A good way to do this is with <code>checkgit</code> on the Unix server.  The
"-run" option will run your program, so you can make sure it displays
properly.  Make
sure your PATH on the unix server includes <code>/home/wffoote/public/bin</code>.
See <a href="../computer_set_up.pdf">../computer_set_up.pdf</a> for instructions.  If
all is set up, the following command should work:
<blockquote><pre>    checkgit -run &lt;git-login> 203 assignment-7</pre></blockquote>
<p>
<code>-run</code> will only work if you have a graphical screen, e.g.
if you're on one of the lab computers.
</p><p>
If you'd like to submit the assignment one day late with a penalty of 5%, please add a file called <code>late_5_percent_off.txt</code> to the base directory of
your repository.  If you'd like to submit the assignment two days late with a
penalty of 15%, please add a file called
<code>late_15_percent_off.txt</code> to the base directory of your
repository.
