  <div class="header">  <h1>Lab 8, CSC 203 - generics</h1></div>

<p>
This lab explores using generic classes.  You'll create your 
own map data type called <code>MyMap</code>, using <code>ArrayList</code>
to store a list of hash table buckets.
</p>

 <div class="header">
 <h2>Objectives</h2>
 </div>
 
<ul>
<li><p>To gain experience using Java generics.
<li><p>To use nested generic types.
<li><p>To practice using maps.
<li><p>To practice using functional interfaces and lambdas.
</ul>


<div class="header">
<h2>Overview</h2>
</div>
<p>
Get the base code from either <a href="lab8given/">lab8given/</a>.
You'll need to add a few basic definitions to get the code to compile
initially.
</a>
<p>
In this lab, you need to implement a map that maps from any key type K
to any value type V.  It must be in a file called <code>MyMap.java</code>.
You must implement it using only <code>java.util.List</code> and
<code>java.util.ArrayList</code> from the java library in your implementation
of <code>MyMap</code>.  Your implementation should maintain a hash table
internally.  Essentially, you're implementing a simplified version of
<code>java.util.HashMap</code>, though some of the method names are different.
</p><p>
The file <code>Lab8Main.java</code> contains some code to exercise your
map implementation.  Some of it is incomplete; these parts are marked
with comments that say "TODO".  This code makes extensive use of lambdas
and functional interfaces.
</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>Detailed Specification</h2>
</div>

<p>
A detailed specification of <code>MyMap</code> is given in the given Java 
file.  Be
sure to name the methods exactly what the specification calls for, and to
carefully follow other instructions.  The initial
java file is reproduced below:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;

// You may not use any library classes other than List and ArrayList,
// above, to implement your map.  If the string "java." or "javax."
// occurs in this file after this, your submission will be rejected.


// DO NOT MODIFY ANYTHING IN THIS FILE UNTIL THIS LINE!
// Fill in you class after this.  Your submission will be 
// rejected by checkgit and by the autograder
// if you modify anything before this comment block.

/**
 * This class implements a map from any key type K to any value
 * type V.  The K type must have a valid equals() and hashCode() 
 * implementations.  MyMap&lt;K, V> supports a public constructor that
 * takes a single int argument, giving the number of buckets for the
 * internal hashtable.
 * &lt;p>
 * MyMap&lt;K, V> supports a get() operation that takes
 * a key value, and delivers null if the key is not found, or a value
 * of type V (or a descendant of V) if the key is found.  The return type
 * of get() is V.
 * &lt;p>
 * MyMap&lt;K, V> further supports a put() operation that takes a key and a value,
 * in that order.  The value is associated with that key value, replacing any
 * other value that might have been stored at that key.
 * &lt;p>
 * MyMap&lt;K, V> also supports a method called getEntries() that takes no
 * arguments, and returns a List&lt;MyMapEntry&lt;K, V>> containing all of the
 * entries currently in the map.  MyMapEntry&lt;K, V> has public final fields 
 * called "key" and "value".  
 * &lt;p>
 * Finally, MyMap&lt;K, V> supports a debugging method called getBuckets().
 * It delivers a List&lt;List&lt;MyMapEntry&lt;K, V>>>, with one entry for each 
 * bucket in the internal hash table.  Because this is just a debugging
 * method, it's OK to return internal data structures; MyMap&lt;K, V> needen't
 * make a defensive copy.  (A defensive copy is when you make a copy of
 * a data structure and return the copy, so a caller can't modify your
 * internal data structures).
 * &lt;p>
 * All of the above methods are public.

<p>
Further instructions are given in <code>Lab8Main.java</code>.  It should
be possible to get the given code to compile by adding a few basic
defintions to <code>MyMap.java</code>, including the <code>MyMap</code>
constructor.  Once the program compiles, you can gradually add needed
functionality.  It might make sense to start with the debugging method that
prints out the buckets.

<h2>Expected output</h2>
</div>
<p>
Once your program is working, you should get the following output.  The
first section, where the map entries are unsorted, might be in a different
order.

<h2>Hash Table Structure</h2>
</div>
<p>
The internal structure of a hash table consists of a list of "buckets."  You determine which bucket to use by taking the hash code of your key, and taking the modulo of the size of the bucket list.  If you get a negative result, be sure to add the size of the bucket list to the result so that it's positive!  Each bucket contains a list of entries.  Perhaps this slide from week 5 will help illustrate:
