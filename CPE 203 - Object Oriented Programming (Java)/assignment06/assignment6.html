  <div class="header">  <h1>Assignment 6 ("Program 4"), CSC/CPE 203</h1>
  </div>

<p>
For this assignment you must modify the "pathing" behavior of all entities
that move within the world.  This is determined by the algorithm they 
implement to choose their path.
</p>

<div class="header">
 <h2>Objectives</h2>
 </div>
 
<ul>
<li>Practice using a functional interface to eliminate the use of
    the reflection API, specifically, any 
    of <code>Class.isInstance(Object)</code>, <code>Object.getClass()</code>,
    and/or the <code>MyClass.class</code> construct.
<li>To modify the code to use the specified <code>PathingStrategy</code>
    interface.
<li>To integrate the use of this pathing strategy and understand the
    associated code example.
<li>Implement the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">A* pathing
    algorithm</a> in the exisiting code by implementing a 
    new class that implements the <code>PathingStrategy</code> interface.
</ul>

<div class="header">
<h2>Overview</h2>
</div>

<p>
This assignment deviates from the pattern of previous assignments.  Though
this assignment does use some design strategies, the primary
goal is to improve the functionality of some entities in the virtual world.
</p>

<p>
In particular, as you are likely very aware of by now, the movement of
the blobs and miners is very simplistic.  You have likely seen an entity 
get stuck on an obstacle or on another entity.  You will improve the
pathing strategy in order to achieve a better result in this assignment.
</p>

<p>
Pathing algorithms are quite interesting, in and of themselves.  Our
exploration of pathing in this assignment also motivates the use of
some design patterns and techniques.  Applying these patterns will also
improve the flexibility of the implementation.
</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>Eliminating usage of the reflection API &mdash; a functional interface</h2>
</div>

<p>
Deriving from the original given code, your implementation of the project
currently contains at least one use of the reflection APIs.  Based on
the specifications for <a href="assignment4.html">Assignment 4</a>,
<code>findNearest</code> takes a <code>Class</code> object and then uses
the <code>isInstance</code> method to find the desired entity.
</p>

<p>
The use of reflection APIs is generally frowned upon, unless there is a
truly compelling need.  Indeed, the <code>instanceof</code> operator is a
part of Java so that the reflective API <code>Class.isInstance(Object)</code>
(or its equivalent) is needed much less often, if at all.  Instead, there 
is a mechanism built in to the language for determining when a downcast is 
safe:  The <code>instanceof</code> operator.
</p><p>
Java was intentionally made so that
<code>myObject instanceof MyClass</code> returns true if <code>myObject</code>
is of type <code>MyClass</code> <strong>or any subtype 
of <code>MyClass</code></strong>.  Among other benefits, this discourages
programmers from
breaking Liskov Substitutability.  With the reflection APIs, it's easy to
(perhaps inadvertently) break Liskov, e.g. by comparing two <code>Class</code>
objects using <code>==</code> or <code>.equals()</code>.
</p><p>
In addition, the current implementation of <code>findNearest()</code>
is inflexible in that only a single type hierarchy can satisfy
the check.  Thus, if a miner wanted to, for example, search for the
nearest ore <i>or</i> blob, one would need to modify the
<code>findNearest()</code> method signature, and it is used by 
multiple entities.  Gaining this flexibility while eliminating the use of the
reflection APIs is a perfect use of a functional interface.
</p>

<p>
To make this improvement, follow these steps:
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>
   Rename <code>findNearest()</code> to <code>oldFindNearest()</code>,
   then compile and run your code.
   </p>
<li><p>
   Add a new <code>findNearest()</code> method that doesn't take an argument
   of type <code>Class</code>.  Instead, have it take a functional interface
   instance, for a function that takes an <code>Entity</code> instance and
   returns a boolean.  <code>java.util.function.Predicate&lt;Entity></code>
   will work beautifully here.  A good name for this parameter might
   be <code>isTarget</code>.
   </p>
<li><p>
   In the body of <code>findNearest()</code>, call <code>Predicate.test()</code>
   (that is, <code>isTarget.test(myEntity)</code>) when the method needs
   to test if an entity satisfies the condition that was passed in to it.
   Compile your code.
   </p>
<li>
   <p>
   Find one place where <code>oldFindNearest()</code> is called.  Change it
   to the new <code>findNearest()</code>, with a call like the following:
   </p>
   <blockquote>
   <pre>Optional&lt;Entity&gt; foo = bar.findNearest(position(), e -> e instanceof Vein);</pre>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
      This creates a lambda implementing <code>Predicate&lt;Entity></code>
      that checks if the entity under consideration is an instance of
      </code>Vein</code> (or, in theory, any subtype of <code>Vein</code>).
   </p>
<li>
   <p>
   Compile and test your code.
   </p>
<li>
   <p>
   Repeat the previous two steps until all calls to <code>oldFindNearest()</code>
   are eliminated.  Remove <code>oldFindNearest()</code>.
   </p>
</ol>


<div class="header">
<h2>Supporting Variety &mdash; Strategy Pattern</h2>
</div>

<p>
When an entity attempts to move, it needs to know the next step to take.
How that next step is computed is, in many respects, irrelevant to the code
within the corresponding entity.  In fact, we could imagine wanting
to change that
strategy for different builds of the program (to experiment), each time
the program is executed (based on configuration), or dynamically during
execution.  An application of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern">Strategy 
pattern</a> allows you to separate out the pathing algorithm,
and easily substitute in a new algorithm as desired.
</p>

<p>
Your implementation must use the given
<a href="assignment6/PathingStrategy.java">PathingStrategy</a> interface,
described below.
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>import java.util.List;
import java.util.function.Function;
import java.util.function.Predicate;

interface PathingStrategy
{
    /**
     * Returns a prefix of a path from the start point to a point within reach
     * of the end point.  This path is valid ("clear") when returned, but
     * may be invalidated in the future by the movement of other entities.
     * &lt;p>
     * The returned value doesn't include the start point or the end point.
     *
     * @param start   The start point for the path.
     * @param end     The goal, the end point for the path.
     * @param canPassThrough      A function that returns true if the
     *                            given point isn't blocked.
     * @param potentialNeighbors  A function that gives the potential neighbors
     *                            for a given point.  This is just the set
     *                            of points an entity could move to assuming
     *                            nothing were blocked.
     */
    List&lt;Point> computePath(Point start, Point end,
                            Predicate&lt;Point> canPassThrough,
                            Function&lt;Point, List&lt;Point>> potentialNeighbors);
}</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
This strategy declares only a single method, <code>computePath</code>, to
compute at least the beginning of a path of 
points (returned as a list) from the start point to the
end point.
</p> <p>
In order to compute this path, the pathing algorithm needs to know the
directions an entity can move.  This is provided to it with the functional
interface parameter 
<code>potentialNeighbors</code>.   In addition, in order to explore
potential paths, the algorithm must be able to determine if a
given point can be traversed.  In our program, this is true if the
point is both a valid position in the world and a location that is
not blocked.  This is provided to it by the 
<code>canPassThrough</code> functional interface argument.  
The pathing algorithm will determine that a path is complete when 
a point is reached that is a neighbor of the
<code>end</code> point.
</p>

<div class="header">
<h3>Single-Step Pathing</h3>
</div>

<p>
As an example of defining a pathing strategy, consider the following
implementation of the single-step pathing algorithm,
<a href="assignment6/SingleStepPathingStrategy.java">SingleStepPathingStrategy</a>.  This is the same algorithm as was implemented in the given code for
the class project.  You should use this as an initial pathing algorithm, as
you convert your program to the new interface.
</p>

<p>
Modify the appropriate entities to use a <code>PathingStrategy</code>.
Of course, you are encouraged to make one modification at a time, then
build and test!  Use the given
implementation to verify that your changes work.
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.function.Function;
import java.util.function.Predicate;

class SingleStepPathingStrategy implements PathingStrategy
{
    @Override
    public List&lt;Point> computePath(
                            final Point start, final Point end,
                            Predicate&lt;Point> canPassThrough,
                            Function&lt;Point, List&lt;Point>> potentialNeighbors)
    {
        ArrayList&lt;Point> result = new ArrayList&lt;>();

        // First, generate our list of neighbors, and see if the endpoint
        // is one of them.  If so, we're one move away from our goal.
        List&lt;Point> neighbors = potentialNeighbors.apply(start);
        if (neighbors.contains(end)) {

            // By our contract, we include neither the start nor the end 
            // point, so if we're within reach of the end, the correct
            // "path" is empty.
            return result;
        }

        // Now, see which of our neighbors moves us closer (or at least not
        // further away), in either x or y.
        for (Point neighbor : potentialNeighbors.apply(start)) {
            if (!canPassThrough.test(neighbor)) {
                // ignore
            } else if (neighbor.equals(start) || neighbor.equals(end)) {
                // ignore
            } else if (Math.abs(end.x-neighbor.x) > Math.abs(end.x-start.x)) {
                // ignore
            } else if (Math.abs(end.y-neighbor.y) > Math.abs(end.y-start.y)) {
                // ignore
            } else {
                result.add(neighbor);
                return result;
                // Our "path" is only really one step toward the goal.  That's
                // OK, because our contract says it's the *prefix* of the
                // path.  A prefix can be just one step!
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
This implementation only matches the original pathing algorithm
if <code>potentialNeighbors</code> returns the same neighbor points, in the
same order as before.  You can experiment with adding other points to the
<code>List</code> returned by <code>potentialNeighbors</code>.  For
example, you could allow diagonal movement, or even allow only diagonal
movement.  Each of these approaches can be tried
simply by changing the function passed to <code>computePath</code>.
</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>A* Pathing</h2>
</div>

<p>
Define a new <code>PathingStrategy</code> subclass that implements the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">A* search
algorithm</a>.  As before, an entity will take only one step along the
computed path at a time.  The <code>computePath</code> method will be invoked
multiple times as the entity moves toward the intended destination.  
As such, take care if you maintain any state relevant to the algorithm.
</p>

<div class="header">
<h3>Testing</h3>
</div>

<p>
You are strongly encouraged to write unit tests for this strategy.  Since
your implementation must conform to a specified interface, part of the
grading will be based on instructor unit tests.
</p>

<div class="header">
<h3>Alternate Traversal Approaches</h3>
</div>

<p>
After completing the above, you might notice an indecisive miner
ping-ponging between two points.  This is an artifact of attempting
to move to the nearest ore and only following one step of any computed
path.  That one step moves the miner closer to a different ore, which
results in the computation of a new path ... that brings the miner
right back to the previous point.
</p>

<p>
Consider some alternatives. Implementation of these is entirely
optional.  Any such changes would be in the entity code, not in the
pathing strategy itself.
</p>

<ul>
   <li><p>Non-fickle: Once a path is computed, continue to follow that path
      as long as the target entity (e.g., ore) has not been collected by
      another.  This approach skips the check for the "nearest target" as
      long as the previous target is available.
   </p></li>
   <li><p>Determined: Once a path is computed, follow it to the end.  This
      approach skips the check for "nearest target" until a new path must
      be computed.
   </p></li>
   <li><p>Ol' College Try: Once a path is computed, follow it at least
      X steps (or until exhausted) before giving up.  This approach
      skips the check for "nearest" target until it has consumed a fixed
      number of steps in the current path, or until it has consumed
      the entire path.  After this initial effort, if the destination has
      not been reached, then check for the "nearest target" and compute a
      new path.
   </p></li>
</ul>

<p>
<span class="warning">Warning:</span>
Of course, it is important to ensure that an implementation of any
of these alternate approaches takes care not to move into an occupied cell.  
Keep in mind that the path was clear when it was originally computed, but 
other entities may move so as to block the path.
