<p>
This lab explores <em>streams</em> through the implementation of a program to 
read in and transform a set of points, where each point is represented by
an x, y and z value.  These points can be drawn to form an image.  The initial
set of points includes a lot of "noise" - random points that obscure
the image.  Through implementing various 
computational operations on these points they are
transformed into a more interesting image.
</p><p>
Streams are a useful tool to process collections. In particular, they allow
operations to be carried out in parallel, e.g. on a multi-core computer.  
We don't need to do that here because our data set is small, but it's a
valuable technique to learn.  Streams can be used even in situations where
parallel processing is not desirable.
</p><p>
A Java stream lets you operate on a
collection of data using a sequence of commands and/or operations.
You can read more about them here: <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html
</a>.

 <h2>Objectives</h2>
 </div>
 
<ul>
<li><p>To gain familiarity with the streams API
<li><p>To use stream operations including filter, map and collect.
</ul>


<div class="header">
<h2>Setup</h2>
</div>
<p>
The given code contains a program to read in the file
<code>positions.txt</code> and create a PNG file called
<code>transformed.png</code>.  It then attempts to create a GUI
that displays the image.
<p>
This data that is read represents a large number of 
points in space with
an x, y and z value.  You are to implement a method called
<code>transformPoints()</code>.
<p>
For your reference, to start with the point file should look like:<br>

<img src="startingPoints.jpg">
<p>

<h2>Stream API2</h2>
</div>

After you have confirmed that you can read and process the points,
work through the following operations <em>using streams</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Remove all points that have a z value > 2.0.
<li><p>Scale down all the points by 0.5
<li><p>Translate all the points by {-150, -37}
</ul>
Be sure that you use <code>collect, filer, map</code> to complete 
these tasks.  <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Collectors.html#toList--">Collectors.toList()</a>
might come in handy.<p>


<div class="header">
<h2>Submitting your Code</h2>
</div>
<p>
See the syllabus for the due date.  Please submit your working 
code to the repository created by accepting the assignment at
<a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/mfGbBd3Q">https://classroom.github.com/a/mfGbBd3Q</a>.
</p><p>
It is recommended that you check your repository using after submitting.
On the unix server, use the following command:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>checkgit &lt;git-login> 203 lab-9</pre></blockquote>
<p>
If the <code>checkgit</code> command is not found, make sure you have
set your path according to the instructions in 
<a href="../../computer_set_up.pdf">../../computer_set_up.pdf</a>.
</p><p>
If you'd like to submit the lab one day late with a penalty of 5%, please add a file called <code>late_5_percent_off.txt</code> to the base directory of
your repository.  If you'd like to submit the lab two days late with a
penalty of 15%, please add a file called
<code>late_15_percent_off.txt</code> to the base directory of your
repository.
