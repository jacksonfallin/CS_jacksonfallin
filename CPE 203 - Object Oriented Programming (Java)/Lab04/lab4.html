  <div class="header">  <h1>Lab 4, CSC/CPE 203 - Sorting, comparisons and lambda</h1></div>

<p>
Sorting/ordering data is a common need in computing applications.  Java has
built-in support to allow for various methods to compare data, which can
then be used when sorting.  One tool to facilitate this is to specify
a small block of code that can be passed around and executed
later.  A convenient way of doing this was added to Java 8:
<em>lambda expressions</em>.  The inclusion of
<em>lambda expressions</em> can aid the
programmer with common tasks.  Comparisons are the first example we will 
tackle in this lab).  A lambda expression can be seen as a syntactic 
simplification of a common use of anonymous inner classes, or even normal
classes that implement an interface.  Though this syntactic "sugar"
is of great value, lambda expressions are coupled with additional support
throughout the Java libraries.  In particular, the
<code><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/package-summary.html">java.util.function</a></code> and
<code><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html">java.util.stream</a></code>
packages provide tools that work well with lambdas.
</p>

<p>
This lab introduces the mechanics of lambda expressions as motivated by
the common task of comparing two objects.  Later labs will revisit the
use of lambda expressions in different contexts.

<p>
The given files are in the directory
<code><a href="lab4given">lab4given</a></code>.

</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>Comparators and Lambda Expressions</h2>
</div>

<p>Examine the provided files in the <code>lab4given</code>
directory.
</p>

<p>
For this part we will compare different implementations of the
<code><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html">java.util.Comparator</a></code> interface, including the use of lambda
expressions.  A <code>Comparator</code> allows one to compare two objects 
to determine which "comes before" the other.  This is done via the
<code>compare</code> method.
For example, one might define a <code>Comparator&lt;Integer&gt;</code>
to determine which of two <code>Integer</code> objects comes first by
ascending order.
</p>

<p>
Various methods take <code>Comparator</code> objects to generalize
algorithms (such as sorting).  One benefit is that passing different
<code>Comparator</code>s allows for changing the order.  Use of the
<code>Comparator</code> interface allows one to remove the "ordering"
logic from the objects to be compared.  This was not true of the older
<code>Comparable</code> interface.  Instead, with <code>Comparable</code>,
the comparison logic is placed with the code doing the sorting.  This allows
multiple orderings of the same data.
</p>

<p>
The <code>Comparator</code> interface requires its implementing
classes to implement a <code>compare</code> method that takes
two arguments and returns an <code>int</code> value indicating
the relative order of the arguments.  A negative return value
indicates that the first parameter object comes before the
second; a positive return value indicates that the second parameter
object comes before the first; and zero indicates that the
values are equivalent by the ordering.
</p>

<div class="header">
<h3>ArtistComparator</h3>
</div>

<p>
Define the <code>ArtistComparator</code> class (yes, for this part,
as a traditional class) implementing <code>Comparator&lt;Song&gt;</code>, to
compare two <code>Song</code> objects.  This comparator could be used,
for example, to sort songs by artist, in
ascending order.  The <code>Song</code> class is in the provided code.
</p>

<p>
Write a few tests of your <code>ArtistComparator</code> in the
provided <code>TestCases.java</code> by comparing two <code>Song</code>
objects.  You may use elements of the <code>songs</code> array.
</p>

<p>
<i>For example, when you compare the first and second songs in the song list, the 
result should be less then 0, because the "Decemberist" is lexically before "Rogue Wave".  Write another test case to test for alternative cases.</i> Note that
the first song is at position zero.
</p>

<div class="header">
<h3>Title Comparator &mdash; As a Lambda Expression</h3>
</div>

<p>
Functional interfaces (those that declare only a single required method)
can be implemented by lambda expressions.  The compiler automatically generates
a class that implements the interface, and it creates an instance of that
class to represent the lambda.  A lambda expression is effectively an
anonymous function.  In Java, it is implemented as an anonymous inner class.
</p>

<p>
For this part you <em>will not</em> define a new class.  Instead,
in <code>TestCases.java</code>, assign a lambda expression to a
<code>Comparator&lt;Song&gt;</code> variable local to your testing
method.  This lambda expression should act as a comparator on
<code>Song</code> objects that orders them in ascending order by
title.
</p>

<p>
Write a few tests to verify that this comparator works.  For the test 
cases you only need to compare two songs at a time, but consider writing 
more then one comparisons to accurately test your implementation.
</p>

<p>
<i>For example, when you compare the first and second songs in the song list, 
the result should now be greater then 0, because the Decemberist's song 
"The Mariner's Revenge Song" is not lexically before Rogue Wave's 
"Love's Lost Guarantee". </i>
</p>

<div class="header">
<h3>Comparing Two Fields</h3>
</div>
<p>
The comparators defined thus far compare only a single field to determine
an ordering.  It is often the case that when ordering two objects
one might want to order first by a primary key and then, if the primary
key matches, by a secondary key.  For instance, one might wish to order
songs by artist, and by year for songs by the same artist.
</p><p>
One can do this quite simply with a single <code>Comparator</code> and a single
lambda, where the body of the lambda first compares the first fields, and
then, if they're eqiuvalent, compares the second fields.  For this part,
you assign a lambda expression to a <code>Comparator&lt;Song&gt;</code> 
variable local to your testing method.  This lambda expression will
compare two <code>Song</code objects by artist, and then by year for
songs with the same artist.
</p><p>
Write at least two tests using this comparator, first on a pair of songs with
the same artist, and then for a pair of songs with a different artist.
</p><p>
<i>For example, when you compare the fourth and eighth songs in the song list, they are both by the same artist, but with different years.  When compared think about what the result would be based on the years of these songs.</i>
</p>


<div class="header">
<h3>Comparator Composition</h3>
</div>

<p>
Another way to achieve the same goal is to compose two comparators into
one, by defining a third comparator that uses the first two.  
For this part you will define the <code>ComposedComparator</code> class,
implementing <code>Comparator&lt;Song&gt;</code>.  This
comparator must define a constructor that takes two
<code>Comparator&lt;Song&gt;</code> objects, <code>c1</code> and
<code>c2</code>.  The <code>compare</code> method must be defined to use
<code>c1</code> to compare the <code>Song</code> objects and then, if
they are equivalent by the <code>c1</code> ordering, use <code>c2</code>.
</p>

<p>
Write a test using this comparator that behaves the same way as the lambda
from the previous exercise.  You can re-use any of the single-field
comparators defined previously.  Write two tests for it, testing it in the
same way as the equivalent lambda comparator defined earlier.
</p>

<div class="header">
<h3><code>sort</code></h3>
</div>

<p>
Using the technique from either of the previous exercises (a single
lambda or your ComposedComparator class), complete the sorting test 
by passing a
comparator that orders by artist, then title, and then year (each in
ascending order).
</p>

<p>
<i>
For this test case, there is a correctly ordered song list to use for your comparison.
</i>
</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>Lambda Expression &mdash; Comprehension Exercises</h2>
</div>

<p>Examine the provided testing file in the <code>given_code</code> directory.
Each test case includes some comments about the intended behavior.  Edit
the test cases so that they all pass.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note</b> that you should read the code to determine the correct expected
value for each test case.  Running the tests and then just plugging the
computed values back in will not improve your understanding of lambda
expressions.  You will want to solidify your understanding since we will
continue to explore this feature for the remainder of the course and because
you will use lambda expressions in Java code beyond your academic career.
