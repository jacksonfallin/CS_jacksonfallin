  <div class="header">  <h1>Assignment 4 ("Programming 2"), CSC/CPE 203</h1>
  </div>

<p>
This programming assignment is the complement of the
<a href="assignment3.html">Design Document 2</a>
assignment.  The general task was already explained; this assignment
description provides additional details and tips for the programming
aspects of the redesign.
</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>Objectives</h2>
</div>

<ul>
<li>To be able to read and understand java code and be able to evaluate the cohesion of the class structure in exisiting code
<li>To be able to implement interfaces and use them to improve cohesion in a project design
<li>To be able to translate your code design from UML into refactored Java code
<li>Specifically, for this assignment, in the actual java code, introduce appropriate classes 
    in order to remove the need for enumerated types and for any other classes that contain 
    methods that do not support the primary role of instances of that class
<li>To be able to make design changes to a large code base and have the code still work
</ul>


<div class="header">
<h2>Task Overview</h2>
</div>

<p>
You must identify those classes with low cohesion and then split these
classes into separate classes exhibiting high cohesion.  Since each of
these new classes will introduce a separate type, you may need to "root"
them at a single type (as defined by an <code>interface</code>) so that
they all share a common Java type.  You will
not introduce any additional classes beyond those used to improve cohesion
(e.g., you will not use inheritance in this pair of assignments).  This
refactoring is quite likely to increase the amount of code through the
duplication of some methods; this is expected and ok at this time.
</p>

<p>
Based on the original source code, there are likely two categories of
classes with low cohesion.  The first category consists of those classes
that depend on <code>ActionKind</code> or <code>EntityKind</code>.  The
second category depends on your final distribution of the methods in
the original <code>Functions</code> class.
</p>

<ul>
   <li><p>Kind: The original source code uses <code>ActionKind</code> and
      <code>EntityKind</code> to allow each <code>Action</code> instance
      and each <code>Entity</code> instance to play one of potentially many
      roles.  You are to eliminate these
      <code>*Kind</code> enum classes 
      by splitting <code>Action</code> and <code>Entity</code> into
      multiple new classes.
      </p>
   </li>
   <li><p>Other: Review all of the classes with a focus on cohesion.  Does
      a class contain data that is not used by all instances of the class
      (i.e., each "kind" uses only subsets of the data)?  Does a class
      contain methods that do not support the primary role of instances
      of the class (e.g., static methods that are used to create instances
      or parse files, but that are not actually part of the functionality
      provided by the instances)? For example, this is the time to give
      the parse* methods a betterm home.
      </p>
   </li>
</ul>

<p>
As before, you are encouraged to develop both the UML design document and
the code refactoring at the same time. You are further encouraged to
implement the refactoring incrementally so that your refactored program
executes properly at each step. You will submit the design document before
the final refactoring submission to allow for feedback on your design that
can then be incorporated into your refactoring.
</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>Source Code Refactoring</h2>
</div>

<p>
   Your refactoring should mirror the work done for your design document
(UML diagram) augmented with feedback from your instructor.
</p>

<p>
   Your refactoring must not add or remove any program functionality.  The
resulting program must work as before.
</p>

<div class="header">
<h3><a name="refactoring">Tips on Refactoring Methods</a></h3>
</div>

<p>
   You can use the compiler (on the command-line or in the IDE) to help
you with your refactoring.  In particular, as you introduce interfaces, the
compiler will report attempts to use methods not supported by the specified
type.  The existence of such errors may indicate missing methods for an
interface or, more likely, attempts to treat a group of objects more
generally than should be supported (for example, because not all of them implement the
desired operation).
</p>

<p>
   As part of your refactoring, you will be eliminating the <code>*Kind</code>
classes.  This is desired to allow each new class to directly implement a
single role, but has the unfortunate side-effect of eliminating a simple
check of an object's "kind".  This check is used, for instance, when
searching for the nearest <code>Ore</code> to a miner.  But don't worry!
Java has a better mechanism:  <code>instanceof</code>.
</p>

<p>
Consider the following tips.
</p>

<ul>
   <li><p>For a class that is being split into multiple class, you can change the
      original class into an interface declaring no methods.  Compile the
      program to determine all uses of this interface (the method
      invocations will trigger compiler errors).  Now determine which
      of these methods must be supported by all instances of this
      interface and which should be supported via additional interfaces.
      </p>
      <p>You can copy the original class to, and change all references to,
      <code>NameTmp</code> and declare it to <em>implement</em> the new
      interface so that most of the code will continue to compile.
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>
      For those methods that are not logically part of the primary interface
      defined in the prior step, introduce new interfaces and change the
      necessary variable declarations to use the new types.
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>
      A check for the "kind" of a referenced object can, for now
      (though we will address this later), be replaced by a use of
      <code>instanceof</code>.  Use this only when necessary; certainly
      <code>instanceof</code> is not needed to check the type of the value
      of <code>this</code> inside an instance method!  (If you don't understand
      why, please re-read the meaning of <code>this</code> in Horstmann.)
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>
      In the case that a <code>*Kind</code> value was passed as a parameter
      to another method (and then compared within it), you can do the following.
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li><p>
      Change the parameter type from the specific <code>*Kind</code> to
      <code>Class</code> (this is a type where each instance represents
      properties of a specific Java class).
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
      Instead of passing a
      <code>*Kind</code> value, use <code>.class</code> to get the object
      associated with the desired Java class (e.g., <code>String.class</code>
      gives the <code>Class</code> object describing the <code>String</code>
      class).
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
      Change the comparison to use the <code>isInstance()</code> method on
      the <code>Class</code> object, passing to this method the object
      to be checked.
      </p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      NOTE:  It's OK to rename or even eliminate methods that are no longer
      necessary.
      </p><p>
      NOTE:  This use of <code>Class.isInstance()</code> is a form of "reflection,"
      and is generally frowned upon.  In this case it is an interim measure.  We
      will fix this in a subsequent assignment.
   </li>
</ul>

<h2>Assignment Submission</h2>
</div>
<p>
To create at empty GitHub repository for submission, accept the assignment
at <a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/ok3fQ85f">https://classroom.github.com/a/ok3fQ85f</a>.
</p><p>
Your submission must include all source files, including any that
are unchanged.  Your grader should be able to build your project based
on the files submitted.  Please also submit the image files,
the image list, and the world save file.  
</p><p>
Please be sure to so verify that you have submitted everything properly.
A good way to do this is to clone your assignment repository to a temporary
directory (perhaps on a lab compuer), build it from the command line, and
check that it works as expected.
